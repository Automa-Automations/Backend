# Bunker is a build, template, configuration and auto testing for unit tests, integration tests & production tests.
# Bunker will allow you to generate templates for projects, allowing you to effectively test every single method of a class, every single module & every single package that you are developoing. bunker will also create a generic template for each service, and also create templates for any service your service depends on, in order to test them with each other "integration tests". bunker will also create a template for the production environment, and will allow you to test your service with the production environment, to ensure that your service is working as expected. bunker will also create a template for the production environment, and will allow you to test your service with the production environment, to ensure that your service is working as expected. bunker will also create a template for the production environment, and will allow you to test your service with the production environment, to ensure that your service is working as expected. bunker also effectively injects code into your project to do monitoring, bunker captures all logs into a single generic database, and also captures errors, uptime, usage & more.
