It's too focused on David Goggins' background and achievements, which might be interesting for some viewers but won't hold everyone's attention. To make it more engaging, consider adding a provocative or thought-provoking statement, asking a question, or highlighting how his story will relate to the audience. This would help grab viewers' attention and encourage them to watch the full video."
