        "feedback": "The introduction to the podcast is not engaging enough. It's too focused on David Goggins' background and achievements, which might be interesting for some viewers but won't hold everyone's attention. To make it more engaging, consider adding a provocative or thought-provoking statement, asking a question, or highlighting how his story will relate to the audience. This would help grab viewers' attention and encourage them to watch the full video."
