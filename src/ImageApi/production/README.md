# INFO

From this directory deeper, we will store code & workflows for generating custom models combining the most commonly used models.
This directory will contain scripts to create finetuned models, as well as automatically generated workflows via manual confirmation on a webapp, and massive gpu power usage.
This will allow us to easily create new models that are smaller in size than lora stacking, but allow us to generate images of the same / better quality
